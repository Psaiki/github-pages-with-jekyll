# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

AI and ML. 
How we need to take a dual prnged approach when it comes to AI and ML.
The first prong is using AI and ML for public good and advancing the human race.

The second prong being proactive in regulation. 

The subtle and hidden third surprise prong being the balance between the two.
